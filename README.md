# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This analysis is carried for Louise to help her understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
This project is particularly focused on the Theatre category and the Plays subcategory. Louise’s crowdfunding campaign for her project “Fever” came close to its fundraising goal.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish.
This will help set her campaign to mirror other successful campaigns in the same category.

## Analysis and Challenges

This analysis was built using an excel model linked to a source data with information on various crowdfunding campaigns. 
Two worksheets were created to show Theatre outcomes by Launch date and campaign Outcomes based on goals. 
The outcome of the findings has been visualized in a chart to provide Louise with visual understanding of the campaign trends. 
Both files are attached to this project.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From this analysis, 61% of all projects under the theory category launched over the period of review were successful, 36% failed, while only 3% were cancelled.
The month of May recorded the highest count of successful campaigns followed by the months of June and July. The chart shows a peak in successful outcomes from April through the month of May.
The last quarter (Oct – Dec) is characterized by a decline in launched campaigns and a reduction in successful campaigns especially in the month of December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This analysis visualizes the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.
Projects goals within the range $0- $4,999 recorded the highest success rate compared to the other dollar-amount ranges, while the dollar-amount range of $45,000 to $50,000 recorded the highest failed percentage.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The major challenge encountered in preparing the analysis is too much data on the campaign funding. It would have been much better if a smaller sample of data was used in preparing the analysis.

## Results

1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

* The best month to launch a campaign is the month of May.
* There is over 50% probability that the project will be a successful project than a failed project.

2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

* Plays campaigns with goals dollar amount range between $0 - $4999 are most likely to be successful compared to goals with a higher dollar amount range.

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?

* One major limitation with the data is that there is not sufficient information to reach a conclusion. 

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

* Multiple tables and charts can be created with varying dimensions and measure. 
* We can visualize the outcome based on goals by country to understand the campaign performance by region.
* We can use Pie charts to see how the various subcategory of Theatre performed. 
* The number of analysis that can be done are numerous.
